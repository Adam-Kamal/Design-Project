        <h1>About Me</h1>
    <div class="apple"><p class="p2">Hi! My name is Adam. I'm a secondary 3 student in a brand new coding class at my high school. It's pretty cool. 
        We've done some coding before but nothing this complicated. I've had my fair share of issues trying to learn, understand and apply
    everything that we are learning but I think I'm doing alright. This website is me testing my new skills and trying to see how far I 
    can push them.</p>
    <br>
    <p class="p2">Some interesting thing about me are that I play competitive soccer. I play for my local competitive team and 
        I love the sport in general, if you couldn't already tell. We have been pretty successful and we just one our season title this summer. Another interesting thing about
        me is that I play a variety of different musical instruments such as the guitar both accoustic and electric, the drums and the trombone.
