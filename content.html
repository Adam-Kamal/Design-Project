    <div><p>The way the game of beach soccer is played is quite different from the sport on a field. On a field, you'd see eleven players on each side including a goalie. In beach
        soccer, you see only five players including a goalie. Another very important difference is the way the ball is moved between players. Due to the fact that the sport is 
        played on sand, they can't dribble the ball or pass as you would normally see on a pitch. They in fact have to juggle the ball and kick it into the air a lot to maneuver across
        the sand. Another thing that makes it a completely different sport from field soccer is the red and yellow card system which I will be covering in the rules of the game
         section. </p> </div>
